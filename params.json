{"name":"Fasta histogram","tagline":"Creates a histogram for the read lengths of a FASTA file. ","body":"### Welcome to the FASTA Histogram Creator.\r\n\r\n### FASTA Files\r\nFASTA files contain genomic information as well as a name for that sequence. The format of the file looks like: \r\n\r\n`>name_of_read`\r\n`NUCLEOTIDE_SEQUENCE`\r\n\r\n### Program Requirements\r\nIn order to run the Python program draw_histogram.py, you MUST have pylab installed. The program uses Python's pylab tool to create its visualization. You can run this program on the command line, by specifying the required parameter of a FASTA file and optional parameter (num_bins) of the number of bins (default is 10). You can call the program in the command line as follows:\r\n\r\n`[user@localhost] $ draw_histogram.py fasta_file.fasta -num_bins 25`\r\n\r\n### Output Histogram\r\nThis program produces a histogram of the lengths of the reads of the input FASTA. Each FASTA input can contain thousands of reads and it is often difficult to get a good understanding of your read sizes by simply looking at the FASTA. The histogram produced shows the distribution of your read lengths, with size on the x-axis and number of reads in that bin on the y-axis.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis program was created at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Apprill Lab by Evan Denmark (@edenmark).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
